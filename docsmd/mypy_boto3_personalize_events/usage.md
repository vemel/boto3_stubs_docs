## Client

### Implicit type annotations

Can be used with `boto3-stubs[personalize-events]` package installed.

Write your `PersonalizeEvents` code as usual,
type checking and code completion should work out of the box.







### Explicit type annotations

With `boto3-stubs-lite[personalize-events]`
or a standalone `mypy_boto3_personalize_events` package, you have to explicitly specify `client: PersonalizeEventsClient` type annotation.

All other type annotations are optional, as types should be discovered automatically.
However, these type annotations can be helpful in your functions and methods.
